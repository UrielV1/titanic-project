## Project objectives
The main objective of this project is to build a reliable and accurate ML model to predict the price of a diamond. 

## Project description
- A dataset of 53,940 records and 10 features is given
- The different features describe the physical and geometrical measures of the diamonds
- Data exploration & Data visualization were executed
- Feature engineering & dimensionality reduction were executed as well
- Random forest, KNN and MLP model were used and the parameters were tuned
- The best score was R-squared = 0.98 with random forest model
